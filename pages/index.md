# Event-driven, non-blocking I/O with PHP

ReactPHP is a low-level library for event-driven programming in
[PHP](http://php.net). At its core is an event loop, on
top of which it provides low-level utilities, such as: Streams
abstraction, async dns resolver, network client/server, http
client/server, interaction with processes. Third-party libraries can
use these components to create async network clients/servers and
more.
