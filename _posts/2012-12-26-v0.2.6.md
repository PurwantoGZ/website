# React v0.2.6 has cache

## Bug fixes

This release contains some critical bug fixes for the libevent and libev
loops. It is recommended to upgrade as soon as possible.

## Cache

This release introduces a new cache component. It was extracted from the dns
component and is now generic. It only contains an interface and a in-memory
implementation. Other implementations can depend on `react/cache` and
implement the interface. It is recommended to release such implementations as
standalone packages, not bundled with anything else, in order to allow them to
be re-used easily.

Sample usage:

    $cache->get('foo')->then(function ($foo) {
        echo "The value of foo is $foo\n";
    });

    $cache->set('foo', 'bar');

    $cache->remove('foo');

README](https://github.com/reactphp/react/tree/master/src/React/Cache#readme).
