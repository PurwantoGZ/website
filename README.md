Setup
-----

1. Copy `.env.dist` to `.env` and add a
   [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to the
   `GITHUB_TOKEN` entry.

   You don't need to check any of the scopes, `public access` is enough. The
   build script uses the GitHub API to render markdown files and fetch
   repository data and using the access token ensures that you don't run into
   API rate limits.

2. Install dependencies with `$ composer install`.

Auto-Deployment with Travis CI
------------------------------

The ebiste can be automatically deployed via the Travis CI
[GitHub Pages Deployment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/)
feature.

Make sure, the required environment variables are set in the repository settings
on Travis CI: `GITHUB_TOKEN` 
([a personal access token](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pages/#Setting-the-GitHub-token)), 
`DEPLOY_REPO`, `DEPLOY_TARGET_BRANCH` and `DEPLOY_FQDN`.
